      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver
      cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody combined
      with a radioactive substance and given prior to bone marrow transplantation may kill more
      cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody given
      prior to bone marrow transplantation in treating patients with acute myelogenous leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the overall and disease-free survival and toxicity associated with
      busulfan/cyclophosphamide (BU/CTX) plus 131I-labeled BC8 antibody (131I-BC8) followed by an
      HLA-identical related marrow transplant in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in first
      or second remission or untreated first relapse. II. Study factors that may influence the
      biodistribution of 131I-BC8 in this patient population, including marrow cellularity, the
      level of antigen expression by leukemic cells (in relapsed patients), and the degree of
      antigen saturation by antibody. III. Determine the efficacy of BU/CTX in patients in first
      remission unable to receive radiolabeled antibody, e.g., patients who are HAMA-positive,
      those not tolerating antibody test infusion, those with unfavorable antibody
      biodistribution, or those for whom antibody is unavailable.

      OUTLINE: Radioimmunotherapy plus 2-Drug Cytoreductive Chemotherapy followed by Bone Marrow
      Transplantation with, as indicated, CNS Therapy. Iodine-131-labeled Monoclonal Antibody BC8
      (anti-CD45), 131I-BC8; plus Busulfan, BU, NSC-750; Cyclophosphamide, CTX, NSC-26271;
      followed by Allogeneic Bone Marrow, ABM; with, as indicated, Intrathecal Methotrexate, IT
      MTX, NSC-740.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: It is anticipated that 30 patients in first remission, 30 patients in
      untreated first relapse, and 15 patients in second remission will be accrued over 3 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Acute myelogenous leukemia in first or second remission or
        untreated first relapse Documented CD45 expression by leukemic cells required for patients
        in relapse Phenotyping not required for patients in remission; such patients may have
        leukemia previously documented to be CD45 negative Circulating blast count less than

        HLA-matched related marrow donor required No donors mismatched for 1 or more HLA antigens
        No psychologic, physiologic, or medical contraindication to donation No high risk for
        anesthesia because of age or medical problems No HIV seropositive donors

        Greater than 60 days Hematopoietic: Not applicable Hepatic: Bilirubin less than 1.5 mg/dl
        No risk of developing veno-occlusive disease of the liver (i.e., current evidence of
        hepatitis as manifested by SGOT greater than 1.5 x ULN) Renal: Creatinine less than 2.0
        mg/dl Other: No HIV seropositivity No major infection
